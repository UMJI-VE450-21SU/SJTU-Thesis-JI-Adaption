\chapter{Conclusion}

In this project, we design a processor based on RISC-V ISA and simulate the SoC with software tools. Our processor supports 4-way superscalar execution and instruction dynamic scheduling, which keeps a good performance-energy-cost balance and involves complex algorithm and logic design. As the project is mainly for research and education purpose, it offers users a good base to explore computer architecture design and optimization.
